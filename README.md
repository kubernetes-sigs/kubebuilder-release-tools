# Kubebuilder Release Tools

Release tooling for KubeBuilder projects.

## Release Notes Generation

The [notes](/notes) module contains a framework for generating release
notes from git history using emoji, and the "root" of the module is
a program that makes use of this:

```shell
# generate a final release
$ go run sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder-release-tools/notes

  generate a beta release
$ go run sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder-release-tools/notes -r beta
```

## PR Verification GitHub Action

This repository acts as a GitHub action for verifying PR titles match the
[release notes generation requirements](/VERSIONING.md), as well as some
basic descriptiveness checks.  You can use it in your repository by adding
a workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/verifier.yml`) as such:

```yaml
name: PR Verifier

on:
  # NB: using `pull_request_target` runs this in the context of
  # the base repository, so it has permission to upload to the checks API.
  # This means changes won't kick in to this file until merged onto the
  # main branch.
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: verify PR contents
    steps:
    - name: Verifier action
      id: verifier
      uses: kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder-release-tools@v0.2
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The code that actually runs lives in [verify/cmd](/verify/cmd), while
[/verify](/verify) contains a framework for running PR description checks
from GitHub actions & uploading the result via the GitHub checks API.

This repo itself uses two "live" version of the action that always rebuilds
from the local code (master branch) and from the PR branch, which lives in 
[.github/actions/verifier](/.github/actions/verifier).

### Updating the action

If you release updates to the action, make sure to tag a new release,
which triggers a build & tag of the docker container referenced by this
action (using Google Cloud Build, pushed as
[gcr.io/kubebuilder/pr-verifier](https://gcr.io/kubebuilder/pr-verifier)).
and then update the corresponding major version tag (either `vX` or
`v0.Y`) by running:

```shell
# where vX is the major version, vX.Y.Z is the release you just tagged,
# and upstream is the remote for this repo itself, NOT your fork.
$ git pull --tags upstream
$ git tag -f vX vX.Y.Z
$ git push upstream refs/tags/vX
```

## KubeBuilder Project Versioning

[VERSIONING.md](/VERSIONING.md) contains the general guidelines for
versioning, releasing, etc for the KubeBuilder projects.

The TL;DR on PR titles is that you must have a *prefix* on your PR title
specifying the kind of change:

- Breaking change: :warning: (`:warning:`)
- Non-breaking feature: :sparkles: (`:sparkles:`)
- Patch fix: :bug: (`:bug:`)
- Docs: :book: (`:book:`)
- Infra/Tests/Other: :seedling: (`:seedling:`)

See [the document](/VERSIONING.md) for more details.
